# 2_function-and-templates

A project for test writing templates with function, and test integration.

There were problems with transferring functions to a function vector, 
although there is no obvious error when transferring functions to a 
function vector, but errors come out during compilation and static_cast 
does not work, it was not interesting to implement a method for working 
with data for each template function.
